# What does Flask do

Flask is a micro web framework used to create web applications. It uses Jinja as its templating engine, to generate static template files at runtime, and Werkzeug as its WSGI toolkit, to facilitate the communication between web server and application. When writing an app locally, Flask will launch a simple "development" server on which to run it.
